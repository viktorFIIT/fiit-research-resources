# Use on Security Patterns 2

Let’s assume sequence of security patterns from the catalog of security patterns. Let’s denote names of the patterns in this sequence with first letters of the words in their names:

- AE – stands for Asymmetric Encryption.
- TPBA – stands for Third Party-Based Authentication.
- MA – stands for Mutual Authentication.
- C – stands for Credential.
- SS – stands for Security Session.
- CP – stands for Check Point.

**Kick-off sequence 1**:  AE -> TPBA -> MA -> C -> SS -> CP

User clicks on the “Insert Kick-off Sequence” button and inserts number of the patterns in catalog of security patterns and kick-off pattern sequence where patterns have abbreviated names. User constructs the stochastic tree for this kick-off pattern sequence by clicking on button “Construct Tree”.

Once the stochastic tree is constructed user can search for the expected pattern sequence candidate on his own. or he can speed up this process by clicking on button “Find candidate”.

After that, the expected pattern sequence candidate is displayed to the user along with probability of applying it. Users can start establishing expected pattern sequence from this sequence by clicking on button “Establish”.
